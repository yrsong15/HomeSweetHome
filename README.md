# Ray Song's Game
First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2016.

## Design
The game will be modeled after a childhood playground game I played back in Korea, a sand dune with a single stick on the middle of it will be placed between two players. Player One removes a certain amount of sand from the dune, after which Player Two will proceed to do the same. The turn will go back and forth between the two players.

The game ends when the stick in the middle of the dune falls down. The player who removes sand just before the stick falls is the **Loser**, and the other player is the **Winner**.

# Home Sweet Home :dog: :heart: :strawberry: 
First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2016 by Ray Song(ys101).

+ Please run Main.java to play.

## Cheat Keys
+ Press "q" during the game to enable **Jailbreak**. In Jailbreak mode, Mimi is immune to every obstacle, and can even move off the boundaries of the map - a literal jailbreak.
+ Click on Mimi during Level One to proceed directly to Level Two.

## Programming Log
+ September 1-11; estimated # of hours: 40
+ Please refer to my [post-project analysis](https://git.cs.duke.edu/CompSci308_2016Fall/analysis_ys101/blob/master/01_game/ANALYSIS.md) of this project for details.

## Design
The game design has been detailed on [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). 

## Miscellaneous

+ Professor Duvall's [example game](https://git.cs.duke.edu/CompSci308_2016Fall/game) was the single most important resource for the making of this game.
+ JavaFX official documentation was also very helpful.
+ Office hours were consulted on Sept. 6th for 10 minutes.
